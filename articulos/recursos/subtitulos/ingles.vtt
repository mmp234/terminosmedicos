00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.040
Hello, I am Maria Martinez and in this&nbsp;
presentation I am going to explain Super-&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.520
Refractory Status Epilepticus through a clinical&nbsp;
case resolved with therapeutic hypothermia.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.200
Throughout the presentation&nbsp;
we will see a brief introduction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.320
we will present and evaluate the case,&nbsp;
we will see the treatment strategies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.400
the additional measures implemented,&nbsp;
what therapeutic hypothermia is,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.560
the recovery and follow-up after&nbsp;
treatment and a general conclusion.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.560
Status epilepticus is a seizure&nbsp;
that persists despite treatment.&nbsp;

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.720
It is a neurological emergency that&nbsp;
requires immediate medical attention.&nbsp;

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.360
To understand it, a clinical case&nbsp;
of a patient with&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.800
super-refractory status epilepticus is presented.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
The patient is a 14-year-old boy&nbsp;
with no history of epilepsy.&nbsp;

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.720
His initial symptoms are&nbsp;
fever, headache, vomiting and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.840
generalized tonic-clonic seizures.
The initial suspicion is viral encephalitis.&nbsp;

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.240
Tests for viral agents were performed&nbsp;
and came out negative.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.480
The evolution of the case is that the&nbsp;
seizures persist despite the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.080
initial treatment, developing a&nbsp;
super-refractory epileptic status,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.080
persisting for more than 24 hours&nbsp;
despite the use of anesthetics.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.760
The treatment strategies depend&nbsp;
on the level where the patient is.&nbsp;

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.400
In the first level, benzodiazepines such as&nbsp;
midazolam are taken, in the second level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:14.160
anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or&nbsp;
levetiracetam, in the third level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.000
anesthetics such as thiopental or Propofol.
In this case, conventional treatment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.240
strategies failed to&nbsp;
control the seizures.&nbsp;

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.920
On the left is a graph of the&nbsp;
drugs administered in super-refractory&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.520
epileptic status, with the drugs used&nbsp;
versus the time of application in hours.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.920
Given the lack of response to&nbsp;
conventional treatments,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.880
additional measures were implemented&nbsp;
to try to control the seizures.&nbsp;

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.200
A high-fat, low-carbohydrate&nbsp;
ketogenic diet is followed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.800
since it has been shown that this diet&nbsp;
can have anticonvulsant effects.&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.480
Magnesium sulfate is taken, known for its&nbsp;
anticonvulsant properties, in addition to using&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.400
human gammaglobulin, to modulate the immune&nbsp;
system, and its potential in the treatment&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.800
of some autoimmune encephalitis has been studied.
Finally, an open tracheotomy was performed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.640
to facilitate long-term&nbsp;
mechanical ventilation.&nbsp;

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.440
A fragment of Mozart's Sonata for&nbsp;
Two Pianos in D Major, K. 448, will be played,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:11.000
which could have a positive effect on&nbsp;
epilepsy due to its rhythmic and melodic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
structure that seems to synchronize with calmer&nbsp;
and more orderly brain patterns. Although its&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
benefits are not universal, it can be&nbsp;
used as a complementary therapy.&nbsp;

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:35.360
[music playing]&nbsp;

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.160
Now we will go into a little about what&nbsp;
therapeutic hypothermia is. It is a medical procedure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.240
that reduces the patient's body temperature&nbsp;
to protect the brain from damage caused by&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:49.480
lack of oxygen. It is the last resort&nbsp;
in the absence of response to other therapies.&nbsp;

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.000
In this case, therapeutic hypothermia&nbsp;
was implemented with the use of a cooling&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.800
machine at 33 degrees Celsius.
Therapeutic hypothermia was effective&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.440
in controlling the patient's&nbsp;
seizures, causing seizures to cease&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.680
when they reached 34.3 degrees.&nbsp;

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.960
On the left we can see an image showing&nbsp;
a patient using this type of machine.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:11.120
After treatment, for his recovery,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.560
the patient was gradually rewarmed to&nbsp;
avoid complications. The patient was monitored&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.240
neurologically throughout to&nbsp;
assess possible sequelae.&nbsp;

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.000
He was eventually discharged from the hospital&nbsp;
and recovered satisfactorily.&nbsp;

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.360
As for subsequent follow-up, it is&nbsp;
worth mentioning the need for continued&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.760
antiepileptic treatment to prevent&nbsp;
seizure recurrence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.960
in addition to the importance of medical follow-up&nbsp;
to control epilepsy in the long term.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:37.960
To conclude, therapeutic hypothermia was&nbsp;
successful in controlling seizures&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.400
in this case of super-refractory&nbsp;
status epilepticus. This may be&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.640
a valuable treatment option in cases of refractory status&nbsp;
epilepticus that do not respond to conventional therapies.&nbsp;

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000
Its implementation requires a&nbsp;
multidisciplinary approach&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.080
involving neurology, intensive&nbsp;
care and other professionals to ensure&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.720
comprehensive patient management.
It is essential to assess the ethical risks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.040
and benefits of the procedure and&nbsp;
ensure informed consent that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.960
respects patient autonomy.
In addition, further research&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:12.000
is needed to determine its&nbsp;
long-term efficacy and safety.
